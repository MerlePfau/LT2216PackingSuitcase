  - text: "Hello dear opponent! Let's play a game. It's called I'm packing my suitcase.\
      \ This is how it works: I will start by adding the first object: I'm packing a suitcase and I'm\
      \ bringing shoes. You will then repeat this sentence and add another object\
      \ to the suitcase, for example: I'm packing a suitcase and I'm bringing shoes\
      \ and pants. Understood?"
